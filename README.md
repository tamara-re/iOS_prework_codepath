    - includes a widget to have on home screen 
3. Duolingo 
    - interactive learning for free
    - incentivized learning with EXP and gems
    - great illustrations and graphics that give the app a storytelling aspect
4. Maps
    - Has options for map view, for example: transit and satellite
    - Displays weather
    - Suggests nearby places by categories

---APP IDEA------
An app I would like to build is an app that has a minimalist to do list. This app would allow you to create task categories to color code tasks or have an icon designated. Tasks can be created with or without reminders. This app would also implement a widget for the lock screen so that task can show up at the palm of your hand. In addition, ideally it would let you edit tasks from the lock screen, by swiping right to edit the task (name, time reminder, category) or swiping left to delete the task, like a notification interaction. 

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- I had a hard time understanding how to use and create the github repository, it was also a bit hard to understand some instructions since some stuff was named differently, however I was able to understand using the slack support group.
